       <h1>Information pg.1: <span class="cinimatic">About me</span></h1>
      
       <h2 class="space-b">No. No no. Just <a href="main.html">take me back</a> dude!</h2>
      
       <h1>Where we're at now: </h1>
      
       <p>This website is simply a design template for me to test my skills and capabilities coding in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML (the coding language I'm using to type this message out). It's highly unlikely for you to be reading this message, unless you're one of my family members, of course. But my point with that was this could be <span class="cinimatic">your</span> chance to learn to code, if you want to of course.  </p>
      
       <h2>My suggestions (Compilers and engines):</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>Scrimba ( It is paid in some aspects though.  )</li>  
           <li>Micro Studio ( Targeted towards game creation. )</li>
           <li>Roblox ( Personal favorite because its beginner friendly nature. )</li>
           <li>Pretty much any compiler you can get your hands on.</li>
       </ol>
      
       <h1>Coding: </h1>
      
       <p>I've been coding for <span class="cinimatic">years!</span> About 4-5, if you want specifics, but I haven't ever really been <span class="cinimatic">'good'</span>, so to speak. The only real reason for this is because I never really put much effort into the things I wanted to do—until about two years ago. If you really do want to code, <span class="cinimatic">PLEASE</span> don't overestimate yourself, like I did, because all overestimating will do is make you upset when you can't do that new, awesome, big thing that everyone will like.</p>
      
       <h2>My personal favorite languages (Compilers and engines):</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>Lua ( Beginner friendly but more targeted towards making games )</li>  
           <li>Javscript ( Less beginner friendly but has veriety when it comes to what you can make</li>
           <li>Python ( Pretty good all around, i just dont like how you need to indent when you define a line of code )</li>
           <li>Html ( Simple, just ancient ) </li>
       </ol>
      
       <h1>Pretty much how it started: </h1>
      
       <p>Since i can remember I've loved knowing <span class="cinimatic">'things'</span> and how they work. One big, older, source for me was <a href="https://www.roblox.com" target="_blank">Roblox</a>, and dont get me wrong i still do love roblox, but its pretty restricting when it comes to some aspects. Major props to my friends on roblox who actually got me into coding. (Looking at you demolisher11, bluefox and gbs)</p>
